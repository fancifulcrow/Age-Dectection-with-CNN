# Age Detection Using a Convolutional Neural Network

## Introduction
This my study of Convolutional Neural Networks for multi-class Classification.

## Dataset
The dataset I used is [Age, Gender and Ethnicity (Face Data) CSV](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nipunarora8/age-gender-and-ethnicity-face-data-csv). The data set contains over 27000 images of faces that are classified based on Age, Gender and Ethnicity. For this project though, I was only interesed in the ages.

## Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
